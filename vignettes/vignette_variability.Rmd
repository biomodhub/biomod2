### <i class="fa-solid fa-address-card"></i> Definition

When modelling species distribution, there is most of the time an **uncertainty** of what is actually modelled :

- the *fundamental niche* is most of the time unknown
- and there might be an uncertainty in the *realized niche*, except in the case of an exhaustive sampling.

What can be evaluated is how much the modeling results are **consistent** with what is known and observed, and how much **variability** is present in the results in function of modelling choices.

</br>


### <i class="fa-solid fa-chart-column"></i> Variability - within the evaluation / importance of variables

Single and ensemble models can be evaluated by several available evaluation metrics, and the importance of variables can be calculated through several repetitions (see `metric.eval` and `var.import` parameters in [`BIOMOD_Modeling`](../reference/BIOMOD_Modeling.html) and [`BIOMOD_EnsembleModeling`](../reference/BIOMOD_EnsembleModeling.html)).

Variability in evaluation and importance values can come from the parametrization of different elements of the modelling :

- **observed dataset**, 
    + through the number of repetitions of calibration / validation splitting, 
    + *illustrating the robustness of the computed model based on the data*
- **pseudo-absence dataset**, 
    + through the number of repetitions of PA sampling, 
    + *to check the choice of the pseudo-absence strategy* 
- **modelling technique**, 
    + through the models selected, among 10 models available, 
    + *to spot the most adapted modelling methods*

</br>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-map"></i> Variability - within the predictions

Making projections, either for single or ensemble models, can produce two additional sources of variability in results that can be explored through two parameters :

- **For single models**, `build.clamping.mask` in [`BIOMOD_Projection` function](../reference/BIOMOD_Projection.html) : 
    + it produces a map of the studied area with, in each pixel, the number of variables whose value is outside the range of values used to calibrate the models.
    + *It identifies potential extrapolation areas.*

- **For ensemble models**, `prob.cv` in [`BIOMOD_EnsembleForecasting` function](../reference/BIOMOD_EnsembleForecasting.html) : 
    + it calculates the coefficient of variation between models' projection, 
    + *identifying areas of disagreement in predictions*.
