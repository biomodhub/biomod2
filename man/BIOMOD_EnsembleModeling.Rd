\value{
A \code{BIOMOD.ensemble.models.out} object containing models outputs, or links to saved
outputs. \cr Models outputs are stored out of \R (for memory storage reasons) in 2 different
folders created in the current working directory :
\enumerate{
  \item a \emph{models} folder, named after the \code{resp.name} argument of
  \code{\link{BIOMOD_FormatingData}}, and containing all ensemble models
  \item a \emph{hidden} folder, named \code{.BIOMOD_DATA}, and containing outputs related
  files (original dataset, calibration lines, pseudo-absences selected, predictions,
  variables importance, evaluation values...), that can be retrieved with
  \href{getters.out.html}{\code{get_[...]}} or \code{\link{load}} functions, and used by other
  \pkg{biomod2} functions, like \code{\link{BIOMOD_EnsembleForecasting}}
}
}
\description{
This function allows to combine a range of models built with the
\code{\link{BIOMOD_Modeling}} function in one (or several) ensemble model. Modeling
uncertainty can be assessed as well as variables importance, ensemble predictions can be
evaluated against original data, and created ensemble models can be projected over new
conditions (see \href{BIOMOD_EnsembleModeling.html#details}{Details}).
}
\details{
\describe{
  \item{Models sub-selection (\code{models.chosen})}{Applying \code{\link{get_built_models}}
  function to the \code{bm.mod} object gives the names of the single models created
  with the \code{\link{BIOMOD_Modeling}} function. The \code{models.chosen} argument can take
  either a sub-selection of these single model names, or the \code{all} default value, to
  decide which single models will be used for the ensemble model building.}

  \item{Models assembly rules (\code{em.by})}{Single models built with the
  \code{\link{BIOMOD_Modeling}} function can be combined in 5 different ways to obtain
  ensemble models :
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{PA_dataset+repet} : }{each combination of pseudo-absence and repetition
    datasets is done, \emph{merging} algorithms together}
    \item{\code{PA_dataset+algo} : }{each combination of pseudo-absence and algorithm datasets
    is done, \emph{merging} repetitions together}
    \item{\code{PA_dataset} : }{pseudo-absence datasets are considered individually,
    \emph{merging} algorithms and repetitions together}
    \item{\code{algo} : }{algorithm datasets are considered individually, \emph{merging}
    pseudo-absence and repetitions together}
    \item{\code{all} : }{all models are combined into one}
  }
  Hence, depending on the chosen method, the number of ensemble models built will vary. \cr
  \emph{Be aware that if no evaluation data was given to the
  \code{\link{BIOMOD_FormatingData}} function, some ensemble model evaluations may be biased
  due to difference in data used for single model evaluations.}}

  \item{Evaluation metrics}{
  \itemize{
    \item{\bold{\code{metric.select}} : }{the selected metrics must be chosen among the ones used
    within the \code{\link{BIOMOD_Modeling}} function to build the \code{model.output} object,
    unless \code{metric.select = 'user.defined'} and therefore values will be provided through
    the \code{metric.select.table} parameter. \cr In the case of the selection of several
    metrics, they will be used at different steps of the ensemble modeling function :
    \enumerate{
      \item remove \emph{low quality} single models, having a score lower than
      \code{metric.select.thresh}
      \item perform the binary transformation needed if \code{committee.averaging = TRUE}
      \item weight models if \code{prob.mean.weight = TRUE}
      \item test and/or evaluate the ensemble models built
    }
    }
    \item{\bold{\code{metric.select.thresh}} : }{as many values as evaluation metrics
    selected with the \code{metric.select} parameter, and defining the corresponding quality
    thresholds below which the single models will be excluded from the ensemble model
    building.}
    \item{\bold{\code{metric.select.table}} : }{a \code{data.frame} must be given if
    \code{metric.select = 'user.defined'} to allow the use of evaluation metrics other than
    those calculated within \pkg{biomod2}. The \code{data.frame} must contain as many columns
    as \code{models.chosen} with matching names, and as many rows as evaluation metrics to be
    used. The number of rows must match the length of the \code{metric.select.thresh}
    parameter. The values contained in the \code{data.frame} will be compared to those defined
    in \code{metric.select.thresh} to remove \emph{low quality} single models from
    the ensemble model building.}
  }
  }

  \item{Ensemble-models algorithms}{The set of models to be calibrated on the data. \cr
  10 modeling techniques are currently available :
  \itemize{
    \item{\bold{\code{prob.mean}} : }{Mean of probabilities over the selected models}

    \item{\bold{\code{prob.median}} : }{Median of probabilities over the selected models \cr
    The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, however it requires more
    computation time and memory as it loads all predictions (on the contrary to the mean or
    the weighted mean).}

    \item{\bold{\code{prob.cv}} : }{Coefficient of variation (sd / mean) of probabilities
    over the selected models \cr
    This model is not scaled. It will be evaluated like all other ensemble models although its
    interpretation will be obviously different. CV is a measure of uncertainty rather a
    measure of probability of occurrence. If the CV gets a high evaluation score, it means
    that the uncertainty is high where the species is observed (which might not be a good
    feature of the model). \emph{The lower is the score, the better are the models.}
    CV is a nice complement to the mean probability.}

    \item{\bold{\code{prob.ci}} & \bold{\code{prob.ci.alpha}} : }{Confidence interval around
    the mean of probabilities of the selected models \cr
    It is also a nice complement to the mean probability. It creates 2 ensemble models :
    \itemize{
      \item \emph{LOWER} : there is less than \code{100 * prob.ci.alpha / 2} \% of chance to
      get probabilities lower than the given ones
      \item \emph{UPPER} : there is less than \code{100 * prob.ci.alpha / 2} \% of chance to
      get probabilities upper than the given ones
    }
    These intervals are calculated with the following function :
    \deqn{I_c = [ \bar{x} -  \frac{t_\alpha sd }{ \sqrt{n} };
    \bar{x} +  \frac{t_\alpha sd }{ \sqrt{n} }]}
    }

    \item{\bold{\code{committee.averaging}} : }{Probabilities from the selected models are
    first transformed into binary data according to the thresholds defined when building the
    \code{model.output} object with the \code{BIOMOD_Modeling} function, maximizing the
    evaluation metric score over the testing dataset. The committee averaging score is
    obtained by taking the average of these binary predictions. It is built on the analogy
    of a simple vote :
    \itemize{
      \item each single model votes for the species being either present (\code{1}) or absent
      (\code{0})
      \item the sum of \code{1} is then divided by the number of single models \emph{voting}
    }
    The interesting feature of this measure is that it gives both a prediction and a measure
    of uncertainty. When the prediction is close to \code{0} or \code{1}, it means that all
    models agree to predict \code{0} or \code{1} respectively. When the prediction is around
    \code{0.5}, it means that half the models predict \code{1} and the other half \code{0}.
    \cr}

    \item{\bold{\code{prob.mean.weight}} & \bold{\code{prob.mean.weight.decay}} : }{
    Probabilities from the selected models are weighted according to their evaluation scores
    obtained when building the \code{model.output} object with the \code{BIOMOD_Modeling}
    function (\emph{better a model is, more importance it has in the ensemble}) and summed.}
  }

The \code{prob.mean.weight.decay} is the ratio between a weight and the next or previous one.
The formula is : \code{W = W(-1) * prob.mean.weight.decay}. \emph{For example, with the value
of \code{1.6} and \code{4} weights wanted, the relative importance of the weights will be
\code{1/1.6/2.56(=1.6*1.6)/4.096(=2.56*1.6)} from the weakest to the strongest, and gives
\code{0.11/0.17/0.275/0.445} considering that the sum of the weights is equal to one. The
lower the \code{prob.mean.weight.decay}, the smoother the differences between the weights
enhancing a weak discrimination between models.}

If \code{prob.mean.weight.decay = 'proportional'}, the weights are assigned to each model
proportionally to their evaluation scores. The discrimination is fairer than using the
\emph{decay} method where close scores can have strongly diverging weights, while the
proportional method would assign them similar weights.

It is also possible to define the \code{prob.mean.weight.decay} parameter as a function that
will be applied to single models scores and transform them into weights. \emph{For example,
if \code{prob.mean.weight.decay = function(x) {x^2}}, the squared of evaluation score of each
model will be used to weight the models predictions.}}
